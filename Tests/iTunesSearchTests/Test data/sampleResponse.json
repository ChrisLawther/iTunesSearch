But when Richard Benjamin (\"Goodbye, Columbus\") opts for the wild west, he gets more than he bargained for when a gunslinger robot, portrayed by Academy Award-winner Yul Brynner (\"The King and I\", \"The Magnificent Seven\"), goes berserk. Written and directed by \"Jurassic Park\" author and \"E.R.\" creator Michael Crichton. With Emmy-winner James Brolin (\"Marcus Welby, M.D.\", \"Hotel\") and Dick Van Patten (TV's \"Eight is Enough\"). Followed by a sequel, \"Futureworld\"."
